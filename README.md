# Ludum Dare 44
###### My submission for the Ludum Dare 44 game jam
###### Developed by Kjip

### Initial Ideas
- Game where moving drains HP and you get HP back with health potions
- Game in which upgrades cost HP

# Post-mortem
### Short Description
Load, Lock, Life is a game about chosing balance between shooting as trigger-happy or save your bullets for a precision-style approach.
Every time you shoot, you lose a bit of health, so WATCH OUT!

### Why I made the game
This game, made in under 48 hours was my submission for the Ludum Dare 44 Game Jam. The theme was "Your life is currency".

### What I learned from this project
As this was my first ever submission for any sort of game jam, I had no idea what to expect. Though this project wasn't as much about learning new stuff, it was more about applying the stuff I already knew, and testing my knowledge to see if I could handle something on my own.
That said, here are the things I learned.
- Designing a game that played good and felt good in under 48 hours
- Publish a game 
- Further experimented with Unity, it's mechanics and UI
- How to get something done in minimal time
- Use my time as efficiently as possible

I also learned some other skills, like:
- Find the courage to "Compete" in a game creation tournament
- How to efficiently read documentation
- Overcome problems that seem unsolvable at first glance

Overall, I had a bunch of fun working on the game, and I will most likely continue developing it, working out all the things I wish I had time for, on a seperate branch.

### What I would change
> If I were to start the project all over again, what would I do differently, what would I change?

- Since I didn't have a lot of time, I didn't get to implement all the features I wanted to. If I had more time, I would have definitely added them.
- Trying to write clean code, under pressure. I did not pay attention to it too much while working on the game, which cost me a little bit of time in the end when I had to fix bugs.
