# Ludum Dare 44
###### My submission for the Ludum Dare 44 game jam

## Initial Ideas
- Game where moving drains HP and you get HP back with health potions
- Game in which upgrades cost HP

# Postmortem

## The Idea
I went for the idea of having a character that could shoot as fast as it wanted to, but every time you shoot you lose a slight bit of health. When you kill an enemy, you get a bit of health back. This forces you to balance out playing as trigger happy or careful gunman!

## //TODO: write post-mortem in full
